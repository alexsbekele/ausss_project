    text: "I was born and raised in a small town in West Shewa, Gedo, a place rich in brilliance and potential, yet limited in facilities and opportunities. Growing up there taught me resilience. We did not have everything, but we had determination. From an early age, I understood that if opportunities were limited, I had to create them through hard work and discipline. Through dedication and consistent effort, I achieved a high score on the regional examination, which gave me the opportunity to join Ambo University Special Secondary School (AUSSS). Being selected was not just an academic achievement; it was a turning point in my life. It was proof that background does not define destiny. When I joined AUSSS, I entered an environment filled with top scorers and exceptionally brilliant students from different areas. Instead of feeling intimidated, I felt motivated. The competitive yet supportive atmosphere pushed me beyond my limits. Every discussion, every group work session, and every classroom interaction was an opportunity to grow intellectually and personally. I also had the honor of serving as the first Student President. Leadership was not just a title for me; it was a responsibility. It taught me accountability, communication, and the importance of representing others with integrity. I learned that true leadership means service. The teachers at AUSSS were extraordinary. Words can hardly describe their dedication. They were not only knowledgeable but deeply committed to shaping disciplined and visionary students. They invested their time, energy, and wisdom in us. Their guidance went beyond textbooks, they taught us critical thinking, confidence, and character. The school management was equally supportive, creating a structured and motivating academic environment. The laboratories and lab instructors provided practical learning experiences that strengthened our understanding and connected theory to real-world application. Access to well-organized labs expanded our curiosity and scientific thinking. AUSSS became more than a school for me; it became a transformative community. It refined my work ethic, strengthened my leadership abilities, and expanded my vision. Coming from a small town with limited facilities and stepping into a highly competitive academic environment shaped me into someone who believes that excellence is not about where you start, but how committed you are to growth. My journey is a reflection of perseverance, leadership, and gratitude. I remain proud of my roots, thankful for the opportunities, and determined to continue striving for excellence wherever I go"

    text:"\Nagaa Ta'aa…\" With those final words, I hugged my mom and siblings and started my journey from Dano Wereda, western part of the zone. It was my very first time leaving them, so it was not easy. To keep my spirit up, I told myself, \"Anyway, it\'s my dream that I was doing for,\" kinda self-motivation. My experience in Ambo was thrilling, living in such a friendly and supportive community. However, my first weeks at AUSSS were a time of big decision-making. The curriculum was so rigorous that it was difficult to adapt. I struggled between two choices: \"I’ll drop out\" or \"I’ll do my best to adapt and score good marks. \" My roommate chose to drop out, but after contemplating every possibility, I stuck to the second option. Then, every day, my experience became better and better, being resilient through challenges. The teachers and school management treated us like family, and it was easy to see their thirst for our success. Behind my hard work was a strong and friendly school community. From class to outside class: trips, visiting industries, museums, and parks to the STEM Center making theory come alive, my perspective on my country changed. It inspired me to think about real-world projects. There were many challenges, but the school vibe was stronger than any obstacle. The humble and committed students at AUSSS strengthened my decision to follow a challenging path. That rigorous environment led me to grow and mature enough. I have unforgettable memories of the love and concern I saw there, which shaped me into the person I am today. THERE ARE MORE TO EXPCET!"

    text: "I joined Ambo University Special Secondary School in September 2021 to continue my secondary education, having graduated from Ambo Primary School. All the school community in AUSSS is very supportive and friendly, so it makes it easier to adapt to the new environment and teaching system despite its rigorous curriculum. Learning with bright students and having smart teachers is the privilege I had in AUSSS. Diligence and commitment are not just advice I receive from my teachers; they are principles I see reflected in their work. The system used there helps me to cultivate hard work, time management, and teamwork skills, which assist me in various environments and situations I encounter. AUSSS is a place to learn, to grow, and to meet a positive and impactful community."

    text: "I am one of the Alpha Senior batch of AUSSS, the first batch to graduate from the school. Having completed my high school journey there, I often refer to that period as the second transformation of my life. It was a time when I truly began to understand what life means, how to live harmoniously with others, and the profound feeling of being far from family. Eventhough I felt being far from family was a challenge, I also found it to be an opportunity for personal growth. It taught me independence and resilience."
